Title: Experimental DBI Backend for Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) 'OGRSQL' Dialect
Version: 0.0.1
Author: Andrew G. Brown
Maintainer: Andrew G. Brown <brown.andrewg@gmail.com>
Description: Provides a basic DBI-compatible backend for the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) 'OGRSQL' dialect <https://gdal.org/user/ogr_sql_dialect.html>. This is suitable for integration of spatial queries and functionality into DBI-based tools, such as RStudio.
    In contrast, these capabilities are not offered by 'RSQLite' package, which lacks the 'SpatiaLite' extension and ability to utilize special features of OGR SQL.
